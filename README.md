# ObserverToOperator

or in other terms: RxJava from scratch

## Goal of this project

I am someone who has to work with RxJava as part of my day job, but I have struggled with understanding its concepts when reading books or tutorials and just can't seem to get it no matter how hard I try, so I thought of an idea. I was inspired by the course Nand2Tetris, which guides you through building a whole computer (CPU, RAM, Assembly language, programming language, OS, etc) starting from a simple `nand` gate, so basically from scratch.
As it has helped me understand computer architecture, I thought I might be able to do something similar with RxJava.

But I don't want this project to be a throwaway project on my harddrive and never see the light of day, instead I thought others might benefit from this idea, as well.

## The exercises

Each exercise will be a github issue and will have a corresponding pull request

### Where did the exercises come from?

I didn't come up with exercises myself. I wouldn't really know how to because, again, I am struggling with RxJava. Instead, I asked Gemini (specifically the 2.5 Pro model on the free user tier) to generate for me a series of exercises over several weeks that will help me build an RxJava clone step by step, but without spoiling the solutions.

Specifically, here is my prompt:

> Good morning Gemini,
> I am struggling to learn RxJava and had an idea that might help me.
> I am currently taking the Nand2Tetris, which teaches computer architecture starting from a nand gate.
> I was thinking if we could do something similar for RxJava.
> Would you be able to generate for me a series of exercises that can guide through building my own reactive Java framework, starting from the very basics and going to complex topics like back pressure and multithreading?
> I prefer to do this over the course of several weeks, where I do an exercise or two per week, like a mini project, in the same way that Nand2Tetris is structured.
> I also prefer less spoilers to the solutions.
> Would I be able to submit my solutions to you for correction?
> And do you mind if I publish my work on GitHub? I will give you credit for the exercises and even add the exercises as markdown files to the repo, so that others can benefit from this project.

## Status of this project

I just started this project and I am currently working on it, so it is still in its infancy.

## May I make pull requests?

No, as this is primarily meant as my own learning journey, I prefer to solve the exercises on my own. But feel free to fork this repository and create your own exercises and your own implementations of the solutions.

If you make a PR, I will reject it without reviewing your solution, so as to not spoil the solution for myself, so please do not create a PR.
